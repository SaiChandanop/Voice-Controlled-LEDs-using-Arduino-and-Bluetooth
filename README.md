# Voice-Controlled-LEDs-using-Arduino-and-Bluetooth
Controlling LEDs with voice command seems to be a difficult task, but it’s easy and you can quickly build it. We just need an Arduino UNO to serially communicate with HC-06 Bluetooth module and a smartphone to send voice command to Bluetooth module HC-06. For receiving voice command we are using “Arduino Bluetooth Voice Controller” android app which you can download from play store
Material Required
Arduino UNO
HC-06 Bluetooth Module
LEDs (Red, and Green)
Resistor 220 ohm (2 nos.)
Arduino Bluetooth Voice Controller (Download from play store)
Breadboard
Connecting wires
HC-06 Bluetooth Module:
Bluetooth can operate in the following two modes:

Command Mode
Operating Mode
In Command Mode we will be able to configure the Bluetooth properties like the name of the Bluetooth signal, its password, the operating baud rate etc. The Operating Mode is the one in which we will be able to send and receive data between the PIC Microcontroller and the Bluetooth module.
